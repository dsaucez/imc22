# Instructions for presenters

Presentations will be projected to the local audience via a laptop provided by the orginizers. This laptop screen will be replicated for remote attendance on [BigBlueButton](https://bbb.unistra.fr/b/pas-cvz-7gm-czq).

All authors must provide their presentation in PDF or PowerPoint format (PDF is preferred) no **later than Monday October, 24 at 2PM CEST**.

The presentations is to be uploaded on [Seafile](https://seafile.unistra.fr/u/d/512fd5bafbde41619d13/), using the password `IMC-591726`. Presenters can upload presentations as many time as they want before the deadline. The most recent file will be taken for projection.

The filename of the presentation must start with the `paper id` of the presentation and followed by any arbitrary annotation using the format `<paper_id>-<annotation>.<extension>`, e.g., `42-instructions_to_authors.pdf`.

## Additionnal instructions for remote presenters

Given the thight schedule and to avoid inevitable glitches, remote presenters will not be allowed to present their slides in live. Instead they will provide a pre-recorded video that we will play locally during the session and broadcast on [BigBlueButton](https://bbb.unistra.fr/b/pas-cvz-7gm-czq). After the projection, authors will interact with the public on [BigBlueButton](https://bbb.unistra.fr/b/pas-cvz-7gm-czq) using their camera and microphone plus the IMC conference Slack channels.

Remote presenters will provide a pre-recorded video of their presentation in MPEG format no **later than Monday October, 24 at 2PM CEST**.

The presentation video is to be uploaded on [Seafile](https://seafile.unistra.fr/u/d/512fd5bafbde41619d13/), using the password `IMC-591726`. Presenters can upload presentations as many time as they want before the deadline. The most recent file will be taken for projection.

The filename of the video must start with the `paper id` of the presentation and followed by any arbitrary annotation using the format `<paper_id>-<annotation>.mpg`, e.g., `42-instructions_to_authors.mpg`.

In case remote presenters have issues with their microphone, the chairperson will relay questions and answers on the slack channel of the conference.

Remote presenters will have the opportunity to test the [BigBlueButton](https://bbb.unistra.fr/b/pas-cvz-7gm-czq) tool on Monday October, 24 from 3PM to 5PM CEST using the access code `591726`. We only provide support for Chrome browser.
